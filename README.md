Projects of Advanced Computer Graphics (ECS275A) of University of California, Davis.
Based on reference code written by Steven Parker when he was teaching a similar course at University of Utah. It can be found in the follow link:

Currently, I've completed three specified projects. 
 - Project 1: Simple recursive ray tracer with specular reflection.
 - Project 2: Anti-aliasing, depth of field and motion blur.
 - Project 3: Global path tracing with direct illumination and indirect illumination, providing effects of penumbra and color shading.
 - Final: Instant radiosity algorithm.
