Currently, I've completed three specified projects. 
 - Project 1: Simple recursive ray tracer with specular reflection.
 - Project 2: Anti-aliasing, depth of field and motion blur.
 - Project 3: Global path tracing with direct illumination and indirect illumination, providing effects of penumbra and color shading.

I'm working on the final project now, which I chose to implement instant radiosity algorithm. I'm not sure when I can complete it but I must finish implementing it before June 7th otherwise I would fail the class lul.
